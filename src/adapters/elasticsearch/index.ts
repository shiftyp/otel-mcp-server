// Primary export - this is the main class that should be used by external code
export { ElasticsearchAdapter } from './elasticsearchAdapter.js';

// Export adapter options for configuration
export { ElasticsearchAdapterOptions } from './core/core.js';

// Note: The following exports are primarily for internal use and testing.
// External code should generally use ElasticsearchAdapter instead of these individual components.
